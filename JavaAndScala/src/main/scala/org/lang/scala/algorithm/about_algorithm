There are some perspectives that can originate algorithms:
-- Break-down complexity: D & C (Divide and Conquer), DP (Dynamic Programming)
-- View differently: data Structure (tree, heap, graph, etc.)

Data structure is about using what angle to observe a group of data:
-- Array can be observed as tree (or further, heap, etc.), which can be observed as graph
-- Different perspectives would yield different relevant algorithms for the group of data
   -- E.g., to sort an array of data, view it as heap, then heap sort
   -- E.g., to search an array of data, view it as tree, then DFS and BFS
   
For sorting algorithm:
-- Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort

For searching algorithm:
-- Binary search, DFS, BFS
