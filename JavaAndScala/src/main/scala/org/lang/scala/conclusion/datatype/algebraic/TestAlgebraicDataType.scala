/**
 * 	This is a stand-alone object to test algebraic data type (ADT)
 *  -- Details refer to "product" and "sum" package
 * 
 * 	Algebraic Data Type (or ADT) in computer programming (especially functional programming) and type theory:
 * 	-- An algebraic data type is a kind of composite type
 *     -- Namely a type formed by combining other types
 *     -- Hence ADT is for the situation where there are at least TWO types
 *  -- Two common classes of algebraic types are:
 *     -- Product types: 
 *        -- Refer to "datatype/algebraic/product" package
 *     -- Sum types (or tagged union): 
 *        -- Refer to "datatype/algebraic/sum"
 *     -- Product types and sum types are the dual of each other respectively
