/**
 * 	This is a stand-alone object to test sum type
 *  -- Details refer to all packages under current package
 *  
 *	Sum type (in programming languages and type theory):
 *  -- A sum of types is actually a direct sum (or logic OR) of MULTIPLE types
 *  	 -- E.g., Boolean | Boolean = Boolean OR Boolean = 2 + 2 = 4 values
 *  	 -- E.g., Char | Char = Char OR Char = 256 + 256 = 512 values
 *  -- Sum type can be enumeration, class hierarchy, rope, etc.
 *  	 -- Typically IN SCALA, sum type can be implemented by enumeration, case class (with class hierarchy or inheritance), case object (with class hierarchy or inheritance), instance polymorphism, etc.
 *  	 -- Instance polymorphism refers to "oop/TestPolymorphism.scala" and relevant Scala files
