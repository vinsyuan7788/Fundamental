/**
 * 	This is a stand-alone object to test product type
 *  -- Details refer to all packages under current package
 *  
 *  Product type (in programming languages and type theory):
 *  -- A product of types is actually a direct product (or logic AND) of MULTIPLE types
 *  	 -- E.g., (Boolean, Boolean) = Boolean AND Boolean = 2 * 2 = 4 values
 *     -- E.g., (Char, Char) = Char AND Char = 256 * 256 = 65,536 values
 *  -- Product type can be tuple, record, etc.
 *     -- Typically IN SCALA, product type can be implemented by tuple, case class, class, etc.
 *     -- Class refers to "oop/TestClass.scala" and relevant Scala files
