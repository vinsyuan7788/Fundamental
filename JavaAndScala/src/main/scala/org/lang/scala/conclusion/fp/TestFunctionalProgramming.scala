/**
 * 	This is a stand-alone object to test FP (Functional Programming)
 *  
 *  When OOP meets FP: function is an OBJECT that is jsut the SAME as others
 *  -- Function has corresponding data type(s):
 *     -- <function1>, <function2>, <function3>, etc.
 *  -- Function has its own features:
 *     -- Can have input and output
 *  -- Function can be instantiated:
 *     -- "val <funcName>[: funcType] = [{] Unit or ([parameterName[: parameterType], ...]) => [{] funcBody [}] [}]"
 *  -- Function can be an argument:
 *     -- Can be passed as an argument for a function or a method
 *  -- Function can be a return value:
 *     -- Can be returned from a function or a method
 *  -- Data operation in FP style
 *     -- map, flatMap, reduce, filter, etc.
 *     
 *  Functions as to other objects are just like main methods as to other methods
 *  -- The only difference between functions and other objects: 
 *     -- Function can have input and output
 *  -- The only difference between main methods and other methods: 
 *     -- Main method is the entry of a program
 *     
 *  Hence FP is still within the range of OOP, while function is explicitly raised up to object-level
 *  -- More details regarding function refer to "org/scala/conclusion/oop/function" package
 *  -- More details regarding FP-style operation refer to "TestFunctionalProgram.scala" under current package
