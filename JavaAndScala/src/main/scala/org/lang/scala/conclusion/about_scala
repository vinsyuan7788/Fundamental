For Scala, since it introduces implicits features, hence from 3-dimensional perspective:
-- If generics is X-axis, then:
   -- OOP features (abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism): z-axis (horizontal angle)
   -- Implicits features: y-axis
      -- Similar as the angle of AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming), namely vertical angle
